# Diamonds Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization using the **diamonds dataset**. The dataset contains various attributes of diamonds, such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and price. The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Files in this Repository
- **23112024.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA and data visualizations.
- **diamonds.csv** - The dataset used for analysis.

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Conduct descriptive statistics and understand the structure of the dataset.
- Generate visualizations to explore relationships between variables.
- Identify key insights related to diamond pricing and quality.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Use
1. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 23112024.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells to explore the dataset and visualizations.

## Results and Insights
- Relationship between **carat weight** and **price**.
- Distribution of **cut, color, and clarity** among diamonds.
- Correlation analysis between numerical attributes.
